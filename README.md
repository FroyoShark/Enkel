This icon pack was created by FroyoShark, AKA Undefined Variable. It is inspired by Google's Material Design, but made for Mac OS X applications. This project began with four icons, but due to the immense feedback I received, I decided to pursue making this my first complete icon pack. I hope you enjoy it!
