Enkel

Enkel icon pack for Mac OS. Enkel is Swedish for Simple.

This icon pack was created by FroyoShark, AKA Undefined Variable. It is inspired by Google's Material Design, but made for Mac OS X applications. This project began with four icons, but due to the immense feedback I received, I decided to pursue making this my first complete icon pack. I hope you enjoy it!
